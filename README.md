 # verstack - tools for applied machine learning

Machine learning tools to make a Data Scientist's work efficient

veratack package contains the following tools:

1. NaNImputer 
    *impute all missing values in a pandas dataframe using advanced machine learning with 1 line of code. Powered by XGBoost
2. Multicore 
    *execute any function in concurrency using all the available cpu cores
3. stratified_continuous_split 
    *create train/test splits stratified on the continuous variable
4. timer 
    *convenient timer decorator to quickly measure and display time of any function execution


With NaNImputer you can fill missing values in numeric, binary and categoric columns in your pandas dataframe using advanced XGBRegressor/XGBClassifier models with just 1 line of code. Regardless of the data types in your dataframe (string/bool/numeric): 
 - all of them will be checked for missing values
 - transformed into numeric formats
 - split into the subsets with and without missing values
 - applicalbe models will be selected and configured for each of the columns with NaNs
 - models will be trained in multiprocessing mode utilizing all the available cores and threads (this saves a lot of time)
 - NaNs will be predicted and placed into corresponding indixes
 - columns with all NaNs will be droped
 - columns with NaNs and all other constants will be dropped
 - data will be reverse-transformed into original format

The module is highly configurable with default argumets set for the highest performance and verbosity

The only limitation is:
- NaNs in pure text columns are not imputed. By default they are filled with 'Missing_data' value. Configurable. If disabled - will return these columns with missing values untouched


## Usage

In the following paragraphs, I am going to describe how you can get and use verstack for your own projects.

###  Getting it

To download verstack, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip
```sh
$ pip install verstack
$ pip install --upgrade verstack
```

# NaNImputer
NaNImputer was programmed with ease-of-use in mind. First, import the NaNImputer class from verstack

```Python
from verstack import NaNImputer
```

And you are ready to go!

#### Initialize NaNImputer
First, let's create an imputer class instannce. We will not pass any argumets for this example and use all the defaults

```Python
imputer = NaNImputer()
```

#### Impute missing values in all columns of your dataframe
All you need to do is pass your dataframe as an only argument to the impute method of your imputer object and store the results in another object

```Python
df_without_nans = imputer.impute(df)
```
By default you will see all messages corresponding to each column imputation progress, data dimensions, utilized cores, timing

In most cases the resulting dataframe (df_without_nans according to our example) will have all the missing values imputed
For now missing values in text columns (not categorical) with over 500 unique values can not be imputed. By default they will be filled with 'Missing_data' string. This action can be disabled

#### Configuring NaNImputer
All the class configuration arguments are passed at class initialization
```Python 
# E.g.
imputer = NaNImputer(verbose = False)
```
##### Parameters

    conservative (bool, optional):
        Model complexity level used to impute missing values.
        If True: model will be set to less complex and much faster.
        Default = False
    n_feats (int, optional):
        Number of corellated independent features to be used for
        corresponding column (with NaN) model training and imputation.
        Default = 10
    nan_cols (list, optional):
        List of columns to impute missing values in.
        If None - all columns with missing values will be used.
        Default = None
    fix_string_nans (bool, optional):
        Find possible missing values in numeric columns that had been
        (mistakenly) encoded as strings, E.g. 'Missing'/'NaN'/'No data'
        and replace them with np.nan for further imputation
        Default = True
    multiprocessing_load (int, optional):
        Levels of parallel multiprocessing compute
        1 = single core
        2 = half of all available cores
        3 = all available cores
        Default = 3
    verbose (bool, optional):
        Print the imputation progress.
        Default = True
    fill_nans_in_pure_text (bool, optional):
        Fill the missing values in text fields by string 'Missing_data'.
        Applicable for text fields (not categoric).
        Default = True
    drop_empty_cols (bool, optional):
        Drop columns with all NaNs
        Default = True
    drop_nan_cols_with_constant (bool, optional):
        Drop columns containing NaNs and all other constant values
        Default = True
    feature_selection (str, optional):
        Define algorithm to select most important feats for each
        column imputation. Options: "correlation"/"feature_importance"
        Default = "correlation"        

##### Methods

    impute(data):
        Execute NaNs imputation columnwise in a pd.DataFrame

To impute missing values in a list of specific columns, use 20 most important features for each of these columns imputation and deploy a half of the available cpu cores, settings are as follows:
```Python 
imputer = NaNImputer(nan_cols = ['col1', 'col2'], n_feats = 20, multiprocessing_load = 2)
df_imputed = imputer.impute(df)
```

# Multicore

Execute any function in concurrency using all the available cpu cores.

```Python
from verstack import Multicore
```

#### Initialize Multicore
First, let's create a worker class instannce. We will not pass any argumets for this example and use all the defaults

```Python
worker = Multicore()
```

#### Use Multicore with default parameters

```Python
worker = Multicore()
result = worker.execute(function, iterable_list)
```
Execution time will be printed.

#### Limit number of workers and pass multiple iterables

```Python
worker = Multicore(workers = 2, multiple_iterables = True)
result = worker.execute(function, [iterable_dataframe, iterable_list])
```

##### Parameters

    workers (int or bool, optional):
        Number of workers if passed by user. If ``False``: all available cpu cores will be used.
        Default = False
    multiple_iterables (bool, optional):
        If function needs to iterate over multiple iterables, set to ``True``.
        Multiple iterables must be passed as a list (see examples below).
        Default = False

##### Methods

    Multicore.execute(func, iterable):
        Execute passed function and iterable(s) in concurrency.

##### Examples
  
Pass a function, one iterable object and use all the available cpu cores

```Python
  from verstack import Multicore

  worker = Multicore()
  result = worker.execute(function, iterable_list)
```

Pass a function, multiple iterable objects and use a limited number of cpu cores

```Python
  from verstack import Multicore

  worker = Multicore(workers = 2, multiple_iterables = True)
  result = worker.execute(function, [iterable_dataframe, iterable_list])
  # note that multiple iterable objects must be passes as a list to execute() method
```

# stratified_continuous_split

Create stratified splits based on either continuous or categoric target variable.
  - For continuous target variable verstack uses binning and categoric split based on bins
  - For categoric target enhanced sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split is used: in case there are not enough categories for the split, the minority classes will be combined with nearest neighbors.

Can accept only pandas.DataFrame/pandas.Series as data input.
```Python
  verstack.stratified_continuous_split.scsplit(*args, 
                                               stratify, 
                                               test_size = 0.3, 
                                               train_size = 0.7, 
                                               continuous = True, 
                                               random_state = None)
```

##### Parameters

    X,y,data: (pd.DataFrame/pd.Series)
        data input for the split in pandas.DataFrame/pandas.Series format.
    stratify (pd.Series): 
        target variable for the split in pandas/eries format.
    test_size (float, optional):
        test split ratio. Default = 0.3
    train_size (float, optional):
        train split ratio. Default = 0.3
    continuous (bool, optional):
        stratification target definition. If True, verstack will perform the stratification on the continuous target variable, if False, sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split will be performed with verstack enhancements. Default = True
    random_state (int, optional):
        random state value.
        Default = 5

##### Examples
  
```Python
  from verstack.stratified_continuous_split import scsplit
  
  train, test = scsplit(data, stratify = data['continuous_column_name'])
  X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = scsplit(X, y, stratify = y, 
                                           test_size = 0.3, random_state = 5)
```

# timer

timer is a decorator function: it must placed above the function (that needs to be timed) definition.

```Python
  verstack.tools.timer
```

##### Examples
  
```Python
  from verstack.tools import timer

  @timer
  def func(a,b):
      print(f'Result is: {a + b}')

  func(2,3)

  >>>Result is: 5
  >>>Time elapsed for func execution: 0.0002 seconds
```
