# to speed up think about selecting top feats based on the binary corellations with target col

# Backlog:
# if datetime col has nan, parse it, predict derivatives, put back together
# make setting for complexity from 1 to 3 (or 1 to 5) where rows and columns reduction is not performed and model conservativeness is rethinked
# set verbosity levels
# user input for filling the Nothing_to_learn columns. Example Sovcom
