Every time you want to update your package:
	- increment the version index in the version.py
	- upload a new version to github
	- create a new release as we just discussed
		First, go to github.com and navigate to your repository. Next, click on the tab “releases” and then on “Create a new release”.
	- specify a new release tag
		define a Tag verion (it is best to use the same number as you used in your setup.py version-field
	- Add a release title and a description (not that important), then click on “publish release”
	- copy-paste the link to Source into the setup.py 
		Now you see a new release and under Assets, there is a link to Source Code (tar.gz). Right-click on this link and chose Copy Link Address. 
		Paste this link-address into the download_url field in the setup.py file.
