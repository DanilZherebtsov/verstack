Every time you want to update your package: 

	0. If adding new Class, (to make it callable after import) to __init__.py add: from verstack.NewClassName import NewClassName

	Also for new classes it is a good practice to add a class version. Check out NaNImputer for an example

	1. update index.rst file in the docs folder and build a new release on readthedocks.org

	2. $ python increment_version.py new_version_index (increment the version index in the version.py/index.rst/README.rst (setup.py version increment will be done later in step 6))

	3. upload a new version to github

	4. create a new release:
		First, go to github.com and navigate to your repository. Next, click on the tab “releases” and then on “Create/Draft a new release”.

	5. specify a new release tag
		define a Tag version (it is best to use the same number as you used in your setup.py/version.py version-field

	6. Add a release title and a description (not that important), then click on “publish release”

	7. copy-paste the link to Source into the setup.py 
		Now you see a new release and under Assets, there is a link to Source Code (tar.gz). Right-click on this link and chose Copy Link Address. 
		Paste this link-address into the download_url field in the setup.py file.

	8. in terminal
		- navigate to the package folder
			cd Documents/code/my_libraties/verstack.git 
		- create a source distribution
			python setup.py sdist
		- upload package to pypi (if no twine package: pip install twine)
			twine upload dist/*  (will prompt username to pypy and password)
			!!! if error:
			python setup.py sdist
			twine upload --skip-existing dist/*

Upgrade package using pip:
pip install --upgrade verstack
