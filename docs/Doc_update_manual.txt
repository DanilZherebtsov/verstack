- The configuration of webpage tamplate is stored in conf.py
- After index.rst update (don't forget to increment version to index.rst)
	- for web docs update:
		- go to readthedocks.org and make a new build
	- for local html creation open terminal:
		- cd Documents/code/my_libraries/verstack.git/docs
		- $ make html
		- index.html will be composed and saved to docs/build

2. To amend the documentation for github & pypi to verstack.git/README.md
